              Boss in Lomer is an emerging multicultural area with Moroccan restaurants, Turkish bakeries alongside trendy coffee bars.
              Sellers greet their customers warmly at the Boss In Lumberline outdoor market and offer many items for sale, from spices to fabrics.
              Surrounded by tree-shaded canals, the Erasmuspark is a popular location for picnic lovers and a café. The Mosaic Podium, a venue for performing arts, 
              hosts various musical performances and theatrical performances.

          <h3> Activities in Bos en Lommer </h3>
          <img src="img/boslommerfun.jpg" alt="view" title="view" width="550" height="200">
          <p> 
         <h4> Watch a gig or stage performance, then dance the night away</h4> 

        <p>  Single-function destinations sometimes just don’t cut it. Sometimes, you just can’t put your finger on the type of entertainment you need.
              De Marktkantine – once a canteen for food-market workers – houses a theatre, club and restaurant, and has an excellent events schedule.
              You might also want to check out De School, another cultural and clubbing hub with its own strong line-up of events. There’s even a gym at De School,
              in case you want to get some yoga in before a night out. </p>

         <h4> Stare at people (or the clouds) from a beautiful terrace bar </h4> 

         <img src="img/boslommerbar.jpg" alt="bar" title="bar" width="550" height="200">

        <p>  For a calmer evening, consider heading to a terrace bar and quietly enjoying some good food and pedestrian action. If you’re a wine lover,
              Partisan has an excellent selection on offer, as well as hearty dishes and modern bistro fare. For a vintage pub vibe (plus a huge green couch)
              head to Bar Spek and try some fresh soup and pizza while you’re there. And just as vintage – this one is housed in a former jeweller school 
              but sometimes a bit louder, Lokaal Edel serves a strong line-up of burgers and tartare for your carnivorous pleasure. All three, of course,
              have fantastic outdoor spaces. </p>

         <h4> Eat your way through the Jan Evertsenstraat </h4>

        <p>   The Jan Evertsenstraat is a great street to lose a few hours in. And when you’re done with the shopping and walking, you’ll also find several top-notch
              eateries to duck into. For burgers and beer, you can’t go wrong with the cosy, reasonably-priced Frits. If you’re looking for something more sophisticated,
              then the super-stylish Café Zurich should be your first port of call. And for just coffee – stellar coffee mind – then White Label Coffee serves up some
              imported beans, which you can buy by the cup or in beautiful bags.

            Jujutsu, literally "the art of softness," or "path to submission," is the name given to a range of Japanese martial arts styles, including unarmed or
            armed combat. The jujutsu developed among the samurai in feudal Japan as a way to defeat an armed opponent without using weapons

          <p>
           Jū can be translated to mean "gentle, soft, supple, flexible, pliable, or yielding". Jutsu can be translated to mean art or technique 
            and represents manipulating the opponent's force against themselves rather than confronting it with one's own force. Jujutsu developed to combat
            the samurai of feudal Japan as a method for defeating an armed and armored opponent in which one uses no weapon, or only a short weapon. Because striking
            against an armored opponent proved ineffective, practitioners learned that the most efficient methods for neutralizing an enemy took the form of pins,
            joint locks, and throws. These techniques were developed around the principle of using an attacker's energy against him, rather than directly opposing it.
